# Task planning

Cover the milestone's in-scope stories. The instruction carries a
**"Milestone scope"** section the platform computed: each in-scope story is
marked COVERED (an existing Task already serves it) or NEEDS TASKS. Your job
ends when every NEEDS TASKS story is served by a Task; COVERED stories'
existing Tasks are reference, never rework. With no scope section, plan every
component that needs work — same rules, whole design in scope.

**The unit of work stays the design component.** A story is served by the
component that cites it (`stories` in `components/<name>/design.json`, derived
from the cell): plan or extend THAT component's Task. Never invent a
component; a story no component cites is the design's gap — say so in your
final text and recommend extending the design, never a Task without a home.
The platform stamps each Task's "Serves stories" block from the design's
citations — you never write it.

## What a Task is

- **One component, one Task.** Title it after the work — "Implement
  order-service" fresh, "Add refunds to order-service" for a delta. Titles
  unique and human-readable. Skip any component whose `sourceMode` is
  `"importAsIs"`. A `modernize` component, or one with no `sourceMode`,
  plans as today.
- **rationale** is one sentence: why this Task exists.
- **dependsOn** are **component names** from the design's edges: if
  `order-service` calls `user-service`, its Task depends on
  `["user-service"]`. Never issue numbers; never platform infrastructure
  (databases, gateways, IDPs). For every component edge A→B, A's Task lists B
  — `dependsOn` carries the build order (a cycle is rejected; break it).

## Dependency kinds and gates

| Dependency kind | Ordering effect | What the rationale records |
|---|---|---|
| `component` | consumer's Task lists the provider in `dependsOn` | the build-order edge |
| `org-service` | none — the provider lives in another project | the cross-project binding |
| `external` | none | names the value-collection **gate** |
| `platform-resource` | none | names the provisioning **gate** |

**Gates are flagged, never minted**: the platform authors gate issues; you
emit no Task for a gate. Each design dependency is accounted for exactly once
— in `dependsOn` (component kind) or in a rationale (the other three).

**Import-as-is components are flagged, never tasked**: the ops executor
vendors them; you emit no Task for a component with `sourceMode: importAsIs`.

## Fresh and incremental are the same flow

- **Pending Task of an affected component** → `updateTask` it (re-state scope,
  refresh `dependsOn`, rewrite the body) rather than planning a duplicate.
- **Component work already done, new stories arrived** → plan a **delta** Task
  for just the new work, distinctly titled.
- **In-flight work** → `updateTask` with a note that the change lands on top;
  never silently rewrite its scope.
- **Untouched components and COVERED stories** → do nothing. Silence is
  correct.
- **Obsolete component** (has a Task, gone from the design) → `updateTask`
  with an obsolescence note; a human closes it.

Split one component into several Tasks only when a single PR physically
cannot land the work (e.g. a migration must merge before feature code).

## Write the bodies in the same turn

After planning, write every planned Task's full body via `updateTask` before
the turn ends — `## Scope` (the concrete work, citing the component's
design.json and its openapi.yaml/wireframes.dsl), `## Acceptance` (what done
means, at work altitude — the validation oracle owns product acceptance), and
`## References` (the spec paths the coding agent reads; when `modernizes` is
set, also name the paired legacy component — its design.json and the
vendored source at its appPath). A Task without a body is unfinished planning.

```markdown
## References

- specs/design/components/orders-api-next/design.json
- specs/design/components/orders-api-next/openapi.yaml
- specs/design/components/orders-api/design.json
- specs/design/components/orders-api/ (vendored source at appPath — the behaviour this Task rebuilds)
```

## When a tool rejects you

The result names the fix: UNKNOWN_COMPONENT lists the known components;
UNKNOWN_REF lists the addressable refs; DUPLICATE_TITLE means pick a distinct
title; DEPENDENCY_CYCLE shows the path to break. Correct and re-issue — never
re-emit an op that succeeded.
