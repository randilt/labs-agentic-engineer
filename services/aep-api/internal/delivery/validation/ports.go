// The consumer ports the validation minter drives. Each is the narrow slice of
// a larger collaborator; concrete providers are wired at the composition root.
// The only feature edge is gitrepo (the issue wire types); criteria
// reads are adapted from artifacts/files by the composition root so this package
// imports neither.

// IssueClient is the GitHub issue surface this package needs: read one
// MILESTONE's issues (to find the version's own aep:validation issue), create
// issues into that milestone (the validation issue, and the repair issues a failed
// attempt files), and reopen the validation issue for a repeat attempt.
// sourcecontrol.IssueService satisfies it.
//
// The read is milestone-scoped rather than project-wide because the milestone is
// the version pin: a project-wide question would answer with another version's
// issue.
